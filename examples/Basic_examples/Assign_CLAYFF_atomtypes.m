%% Example on how to assign CLAYFF atomtypes to a mineral atom struct
% See also the <Advanced_examples.html advanced examples>

%% First set some convenient matlab settings
format compact; set(gcf,'Visible','on');

%% Set input and output filenames
filename_in='Pyrophyllite.pdb'; % default is 'Pyrophyllite.pdb'
filename_out='6x4x1_MMT_clayff_2004.pdb'; % default is 'Pyrophyllite.pdb'

%% Import a unit cell structure and replicate it into a mineral layer
% Normally, when constructing a mineral particle and assigning the 
% CLAYFF atomtypes, one usually start of by building the mineral particle
% from an X-ray determined unit cell structure. In this example we will
% demonstrate how to generate a montmorillonite layer particle from a
% pyrophyllite unit cell. Both minerals are so-called 2:1 T-O-T sheet 
% silicate minerals, with the difference between the two isostructural 
% minerals being (as you may know) the fact that montmorillonite carries 
% charge defects due to isomorphic substitution. For montmorillonite this 
% means substitution of Si4+ with Al3+ in the two tetrahedral sheets, or 
% octahedral Al3+ with Mg2+ or Fe2+ in the octahedral sheet of the 
% montmorillonite layer.

atom = import_atom(filename_in); % Imports a pyrophyllite unit cell
atom = replicate_atom(atom,Box_dim,[6 4 1]); % Replicate the structure by 6x4x1 into a Pyrophyllite clay layer

%% Perform isomorphic substitution using <substitute_atom.html substitute_atom>
% <substitute_atom.html substitute_atom> was written with centrosymmetric
% minerals in mind, therfore it works best if the layer is centered at z=0 
% in the xy-plane. It can handle both substitutions in the octahedral as
% well as in the tetrahedral sheets. It distributes the substituted sites
% randomly, except for the fact that one can choose a nearest distance
% between the substituted sites, which in this example is 5.5 Ångström. We
% do this to avoid oxygen atoms facing two substituted sites at the same
% time (Google Löwenstein's rule).

atom = substitute_atom(atom,Box_dim,6*4*2/3,'Al','Mgo',5.5) % Perform octahedral (only) substitutions on 2/3's of all Al sites. Here 5.5 is the minimum distance between the substituted Mg2+ sites
% atom = substitute_atom(atom,Box_dim,14,'Al','Mgo',5.5,2,'Si','Al',5.5) % 14 octahedral substitutions and 2 tetrahedral substitutions

%% Assign the CLAYFF (Cygan, 2004) atomtypes to the montmorillonite atom struct
atom_clayff2004 = clayff_2004_atom(atom,Box_dim,'clayff_2004') % Assign the clayff atom types to the atomstruct
% atom_clayff2004 = clayff_2004_atom(atom,Box_dim,'clayff_2004','spc',[1 2]) % In case of 14 octahedral substitutions and 2 tetrahedral substitutions as above, add a final argument [1 2] to iterate over the structure twice the assign the atomtypes correctly

%% Write a CLAYFF (Cygan, 2004) .pdb file
write_atom_pdb(atom_clayff2004,Box_dim,filename_out); % Print the clay sheet to a .pdb file

%% Assign modified CLAYFF atomtypes to the montmorillonite atom struct
% The original CLAYFF does not contain all different atomtypes needed to
% model all sorts of clays/minerals, like for instance clay layers with 
% edges. Hence modifications to CLAYFF exist...
% In this example we are going to use another function, simply called
% <clayff_atom.html clayff_atom> thats different from the original 
% <clayff_2004_atom.html clayff_2004_atom> function in two ways. Primarily 
% it uses different atom names (see conversion list below). Secondly, it
% contains new oxygen atomtypes that do not exist in the original CLAYFF
% publication from Cygan et al in 2004, which can be used to model lets say
% clay edges. The partial charges of any new oxygen atomtypes can be
% derived using the following equation below, and is derived and related to
% the bond valence of the oxygen atoms, see related references:
% <https://doi.org/10.1346/CCMN.2016.0640403 Tournassat et al, 2016> 
% and <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2016.11.084 Lammers et al, 2017>.

% $$Z_{O} = 2 - \sum_i \frac{( Z^F_i - Z^p_I )}{CN_i}$$
% 
% $Z_{O}$ is the partial charge of the oxygen atom, and the summation is
% taken over all neighbouring cations, where $Z^F_i$ is the formal charge, 
% $Z^p_I$ is the partial charge and $CN_I$ is the coordination number of 
% the cation. Although not explicitly stated/used in the original CLAYFF 
% publication by Cygan et al 2004, this formula can also be used to calculate 
% the partial charge of the oxygen atomtypes in the original CLAYFF. Hence 
% one can assume that the partial charge of any new oxygen atomtype 
% calculated in this way is (more or less...) consisted with all the other 
% atoms/charges in CLAYFF. 
% 
% Below is the list of atomtype names from the
% Cygan, 2004 paper and the ones modified here, having atomtype names that 
% simply make more sense to me. Note that I have also added a few to the 
% Cygan, (Cygan et al 2004) atomtypes, like oahe/oahhe/oshe etc.

% CLAYFF from Cygan, 2004    = {'h*','ho','o*','oh','ob','obos','obts','obss', 'ohs', 'oas', 'oahhe','oahe', 'oshe','st','ao','at','mgo', 'mgh','cao','cah','feo','lio','Li','Na','K','Rb','Cs','Mg','Ca','Sr','Ba','F','Cl','Br','I'}';

%% Assign the modified CLAYFF atomtypes to the montmorillonite atom struct
atom_clayff = clayff_atom(atom,Box_dim) % Assign the clayff atom types to the atomstruct
% atom_clayff = clayff_atom(atom,Box_dim,'clayff','spc',[1 2]) % In case of 14 octahedral substitutions and 2 tetrahedral substitutions as above, add a final argument [1 2] to iterate over the structure twice the assign the atomtypes correctly

%% Heal and assign the modified CLAYFF atomtypes to the montmorillonite atom struct
% In cases were atoms need healing, or in order to protonate edge groups,
% one can use a slighlt longer command like below. For more info look into
% the <clayff_atom.html clayff_atom> function and lines 49-80.
atom_clayff = clayff_atom(atom_clayff,Box_dim,'clayff','spc',[1:7]) % Assign the clayff atom types to the atomstruct

%% Write the new modified CLAYFF .pdb file
